# Be-Your-Best-Self

Building AI course project


## Summary

Facial-recognition software is informing you if you are not at your best state of mind and tools like meditations, music or your favourite photos are presented to you in order to get you back to positive states of mind.

## Background

Today it is not easy to stay positive and to nurture your mind. We often need to correct our behaviours and change our emotional states to be able to deal with daily challanges. The main idea of this project is that you are alerted when you are not in desirable state of mind. So when your mind starts to go to negative emotions, you are alerted and based on the emotion best tool to get back in good state is offered to you. In that way you will not stay in that negative states of mind for long time.


## How is it used?

Example 1:
You are working on your computer. Camera on your screen is turned on. Facial-recognition software is constantly reading your emotions. You received an email that makes you anxious and you stayed anxious for some time. Facial-recognition software captured that emotion and gently alerts you that you are not in the best mental shape. It is offering you to stop for a moment and guides you through special meditation for relesing anxeity. As you finish with meditation, you are back on track and ready to deal with that email.

Example 2:
You do not feel ok, actually you feel worried about something. You take your mobile phone, open the application. Application starts to read your emotions using facial-recognition. It detects that you are worried and even scared and leads you through guided meditation designed to help you deal with worry and fear. After meditation is finished, you are presented with several photos of your family ans friends. Now you feel strong and ready to deal with the problem that made you worry in the first place.

Note: solutions that are offered to you depend on your preferences. You choose if you prefer meditations, music, quotes, photos...

## Data sources and AI methods

Datasets for face recognition projects already exists, for example:Google facial expression comparison dataset.

## Challenges

System is not perfect and can make mistakes while reading your emotions or suggesting you the solutions. It only produce results as long as you do the work (you need to perform the tasks that app suggested to you in order to feel better - for example do the meditation).


## What next?

To realize initial idea it will take programers and meditation expert to record guided meditation for specific purposes.
